## What agent-compact-advisor does on your machine

It reads the session's context size, its running agents, agent-shell-watch's
call list when that mod is loaded, and the last answer of each main turn. It
never compacts by itself and never cancels a compaction; it adds a fixed
preservation template to the instructions of `/compact` and auto-compaction.

The model check is on by default: the last answer's final 6000 characters are
sent to haiku through your Claude Code session's own API client and credentials
when the answer is eligible for checking. It can only add an unfinished-work
gate, never lift one. Set `modelCheck` to false to disable it.

Separately, the last answer's final 8000 characters are posted to Kev's
System One endpoint (`systemOneUrl`, default `http://127.0.0.1:8010`) for the
P1 signal. Only a loopback host is accepted; any other URL, or an empty one,
turns P1 off and nothing is sent. Whatever listens on that loopback port
receives the text and is trusted with it: the host's fetch follows redirects,
so such a service could pass it on, as it could by any other means. No key, no
telemetry, nothing stored across sessions.
